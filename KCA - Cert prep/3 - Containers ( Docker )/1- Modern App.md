# Text Elements
Modern Infrastructures and Applications with Container ^XYv3fQbS

Microservices and containers have probably been the most frequently mentioned buzzwords in recent years ^PRCf69zL

Although both terms are definitely related when talking about modern applications ^q02VmdTl

As we will probably read about on every IT medium, the concept of microservices is key in 
the development of new modern applications. ^7pnBXtch

A modern application has the following features:

The components will be based on microservices.
The application component's health will be based on resilience.
The component's states will be managed externally.
It will run everywhere.
It will be prepared for easy component updates.
Each application component will be able to run on its own but will provide a way to be consumed by other components. ^dCz1bhqp

* Understanding the evolution of applications
* Infrastructures
* Processes
* Microservices and processes
* What are containers?
* main concepts of containers
* Docker components ( no sure with the shift go on tour Containerd)  
* Building, shipping, and running workflows
* Windows containers (Just mention it no need to go deep )
* Customizing Docker (same as above)
* Docker security (check if the same config apply to OCI containers ) ^8wuGnLGu

make sure to cover the following topics: ^FMN5i755

Note for me  ^k7rj1TLh
