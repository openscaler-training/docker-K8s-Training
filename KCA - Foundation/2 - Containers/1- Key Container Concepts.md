# Text Elements
Modern Infrastructures and Applications with Container ^XYv3fQbS

Microservices and containers have probably been the most frequently mentioned buzzwords in recent years ^PRCf69zL

Although both terms are definitely related when talking about modern applications ^q02VmdTl

In this parts, we will cover the following topics:

* Understanding the evolution of applications
* Infrastructures
* Processes
* Microservices and processes
* What are containers?
* Learning about the main concepts of containers
* Docker components
* Building, shipping, and running workflows
* Windows containers
* Customizing Docker
* Docker security ^G3Q9IuoY

As we will probably read about on every IT medium, the concept of microservices is key in 
the development of new modern applications. ^7pnBXtch

A modern application has the following features:

The components will be based on microservices.
The application component's health will be based on resilience.
The component's states will be managed externally.
It will run everywhere.
It will be prepared for easy component updates.
Each application component will be able to run on its own but will provide a way to be consumed by other components. ^dCz1bhqp
