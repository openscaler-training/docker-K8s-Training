# Text Elements
The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),
 in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. ^rORCIKSg

As one of the highest velocity open source projects, Kubernetes use is exploding. 
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is committed to growing the community of Kubernetes Administrators, thereby allowing
continued growth across the broad set of companies and organizations that are using Kubernetes. ^y8HMHr8L

, allowing certified administrators to quickly establish their credibility and value 
 ^ez7Dq9e6

Certification is a key step in that process ^ay25QBLh

in the job market, and also allowing companies to more quickly hire high-quality teams to support their growth. ^Wy6twYOV

About the program ^UcLQBskc

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence
in a hands-on, command-line environment. ^U9cXvyII

The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program is to provide assurance that CKAs have the skills, 
knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators. ^YDSR2PEJ

The CKA program is separate from Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP) program. You can become a CKA without
needing to be involved with a KCSP,  ^DNRznIrZ

but for a company to become a KCSP it must employ at least three CKAs. You can  ^YnnFVJv3

learn more about the KCSP program. ^PkljuwWJ
